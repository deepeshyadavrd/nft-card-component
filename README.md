## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this nft preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.container .main-image div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%, 60%);
  width: 100%;
  height: calc(100% - 5px);
  z-index: 999;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

Want to practice more mobile first workflow and responsive web develpment. Learning flexbox and grid to design my layout for a web-page.
